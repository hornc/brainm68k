In 1993 Urban Müller invented a Turing tarpit programming language for which he created a tiny 240 byte compiler for the Amiga.

This repo collects some basic utilities, written in bf, for working with the original `bfc` compiler and its compiled output.


* [m68kd.bf](m68kd.bf) decompiler: Takes an AmigaOS 2.0 executable generated by Urban Müller's original 240 byte bf compiler `bfc` and decompiles it back into bf source.
* [gengen.bf](gengen.bf) generator: Takes a text (NULL terminated binary) or AmigaOS 2.0 executable file as input and outputs bf code to reproduce those bytes as output.

Assumes 8-bit wrapping cells. Tested using Urban Müller's 240 byte bf compiler `bfc` running under [vamos](https://github.com/cnvogelg/amitools/blob/master/docs/vamos.md) (virtual AmigaOS runtime) on Linux.
